# visionOS Demo
## Try out the visionOS system in your Quest headset.

Welcome to the unofficial recreation of Apple's visionOS for the Meta Quest series! I'll be creating the visionOS systems as close as I can get it, and showing you how to do it as well in this [YouTube tutorial series](https://youtu.be/RpHAZ0N5W1s&list=PLwz27aQG0IIIBnLFnAj4he7Mp2mD5Mmh2). This project was inspired by the video demonstration by [ThrillSeeker](https://youtu.be/rjyUuLR8zoo).

This repository allows users with a Meta Quest 2, 3, or Pro to experience Apple's visionOS system on their headsets. Whether you're an Apple enthusiast, a VR developer or a casual user who wants to try out different VR experiences, this project is for you.

As an added bonus, we are also including a Unity project that you can manipulate and use as you see fit.

## Installation

First, you will need to sideload the visionOS application onto your Meta Quest headset. Don't worry if you're unfamiliar with the process, as [this video](https://youtu.be/RoIXxIfRNTw) provides an excellent step-by-step guide on how to do it.

1. Download the latest 'visionOS Demo' APK from the [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hHDEBEsZ8gF5fPT-k_fPLhHiofy19dpN?usp=sharing).
2. Follow the sideloading instructions in [this video](https://youtu.be/RoIXxIfRNTw).
3. Once you've completed the sideloading process, you should be able to access 'visionOS Demo' from your headset's library in the 'Unlisted Apps' category.

## Usage

Upon opening the visionOS application on your Meta Quest headset, you'll be presented with a recreation of Apple's visionOS interface. Explore and interact with the interface as you would in a normal VR environment.

Remember, this is an unofficial recreation, so not all functionalities from the real visionOS are available. However, we're always working to add new features and make the experience as close to the real thing as possible!

## Unity Project

As part of this project, we're including a Unity project in the repository. This is meant to serve as a starting point for those interested in VR development.

Feel free to manipulate, expand, and use this Unity project as you see fit! To access it:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Unity project folder in Unity Hub.
3. Start experimenting!
